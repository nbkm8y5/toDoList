Using Agile Methodology

## 1. User Stories - representing new functionality

    Complete to do list
    Add custom splash screen
    Add custom app icon

## 2. Bugs – representing work to address a defect

## 3. Chores – representing work that must be done, but provide no direct business value

## 4. Epics – representing big user stories. Originally defined as too big to fit in an iteration (the equivalent of a Scrum sprint)

## 5. Prototypes (a form of risk mitigation) – representing proof of concepts that help provide information for decision making around whether some functionality may be valuable
